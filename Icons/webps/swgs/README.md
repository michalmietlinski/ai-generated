## About SVG Files

The SVG files generated by this tool:

- Are vector-based graphics (scalable without losing quality)
- Can be opened in most vector graphics editors (Inkscape, Illustrator, etc.)
- Can be used on websites and viewed in modern browsers
- May be further optimized using SVG optimization tools if needed

The directory structure from your input folder is preserved here.
